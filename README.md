# py3dTCorr

This is a python version of AFNI's 3dTCorr function to calculate correlation across all voxels in a mask. This uses significantly less amount of RAM and computational time in calculating the corralations. Output is saved in a hdf5 file instead of images. 

Some functions in the original 3dTCorr function may be missing.
